description: Using Momentic on Amazon Linux
---

Amazon Linux is an architecture commonly used for self-hosting runners on platforms such as Jenkins, Buildkite, and Github Actions.

Due to Chromium dependency limitations, the Momentic CLI cannot run tests directly on Amazon Linux machines. However, it is possible to run a Docker image on Amazon Linux that then invokes Momentic.

An example of such a setup integrated with Github Actions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/momentic-ai/momentic-github-actions-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-amazon-linux.yml). This configuration assumes that the Momentic API key is available as a [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) in your repository. Replace all placeholder values in the YAML template before shipping to production.
