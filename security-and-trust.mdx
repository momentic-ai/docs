## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Momentic store or see my login credentials?">
    No. Momentic never stores nor sees your login credentials. You sign in
    directly with our authentication provider which provides connections to
    Google, Microsoft, and GitHub.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who is your cloud service provider and what region are your instances located in?">
    Momentic is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Our instances are located in
    the 'us' (United States) region.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can Momentic permanently delete my data?">
    None of your data is edited or deleted without your interaction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Momentic handle secrets like passwords in tests?">
    Momentic has a permissions model following the principle of least privilege.
    Users can be an admin, editor, or viewer. Only admins and editors have
    access to view and edit secrets. Secrets are encrypted and never leave our
    platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is data passed to AI providers?">
    Momentic uses OpenAI and Anthropic as our AI providers. During step
    execution, we send the current browser state and the step content to LLMs
    for analysis. We audit all data passed over the wire to ensure no sensitive
    data ever leaves the Momentic platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Momentic access my source code?">
    Momentic does not need access to your source code. It uses a browser to
    interact with your application like an end user. The only pieces of data
    that are passed to Momentic’s infrastructure are screenshots and a processed
    version of the accessibility tree.
