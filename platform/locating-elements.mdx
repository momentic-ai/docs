## Writing element descriptors

### Be specific

<Tip>
  Playwright recommends locators use accessibility attributes such as
  placeholders, alt text, and role. Read more
  [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators).
</Tip>

Describe the desired element with a specific [web accessibility role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles), such as "the submit **button**", "the homepage **link**", or "password **input**". If you are unsure what type of element you are targeting, you can use the [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/full-accessibility-tree#full_accessibility_tree_in_devtools) to find out.

Momentic's AI by default uses the accessibility tree to understand your application. We are able to view all accessibility attributes and text contents so you can write descriptions like `input with placeholder "email"` and our AI will be able to find it.

You can be as specific as you desire and our AI **will dynamically auto-heal descriptions** within a certain threshold.

### Include labels

If the desired element has a label, include that in your descriptor, such as "the **search** button" or "the **username** textbox". Our AI web agent will generally attempt to match this label to the "name", "id", or ["aria-label"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) attribute of HTML elements on your website. Defining ARIA attributes not only improves the performance of Momentic tests, but also helps your website stay compliant with [ADA standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/).

### Include position cues

<Tip>
  When you're using `nth` or `closest`, make sure to turn the cache off for that
  step. This will ensure that the AI will re-evaluate the page and find the
  correct element.
</Tip>

In general, Momentic's AI does an excellent job identifying elements by its name or the text it contains as it appears on the screen; however, in some cases (e.g., when there are multiple instances of the same element on the screen), you will need to specify a relative location to provide a better context to identify it.

You can provide cues such as "...**below** the 'Introduction' header" or "...**beside** the 'Back' button". Only use positioning cues if they are expected to be stable over time.

You can also use the `inside` keyword to specify the parent element of another element. For example, "the 'Submit' button **inside** the user dialog".

You can also use the `nth` keyword to specify the position of an element in a list. For example, "the **second** 'Submit' button".

You can also use the `closest` keyword to specify the closest element to another element. For example, "the **closest** 'Submit' button to the 'Username' input".

### Tips

1. By default, our AI uses the accessibility tree of the **whole web page**, so it can also locate elements not visible in the current viewport.
2. When an element can’t be found, that is usually a signal that it is missing accessibility attributes such as `role` or `name`. For more on web accessibility guidelines, [go here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Your users will thank you!
3. As a last resort, you can open Chrome DevTools and turn on [full-page accessibility tree](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference#explore-tree). This is similar to how our AI views your app. For example: _"Search… searchbox"_ or _"docs link"_ will correctly locate it on the page.

## Using `data-testid`s and CSS selectors

<Warning>
  Using CSS selectors is not recommended as it can lead to test flakiness.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Selectors that resolve to multiple elements will error. Make sure your CSS
  selectors are specific and only resolve to a single element.
</Info>

Momentic supports CSS selectors as an escape hatch. We don’t recommend this as it is much more brittle and can lead to test flakiness. You can turn on CSS selector support by toggling the option in the step settings.

You are able to locate elements using `data-testid` attributes. For example: `[data-testid="value"]`.

You are also able to locate elements by using CSS selectors. For example: `input#username` or `button.mui.primary`.
