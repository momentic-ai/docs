## Accessing data

All steps has access to the following variables:

- `env`: An object containing any configured environment variables, as well as any dynamic variables set through `setVariable` during the test. The following variables are automatically set in the `env` object:
  - `BASE_URL` : the starting URL of the test.
  - `CURRENT_URL` : the current URL of the active page. This is updated after every step.
- `results`: An array containing the results of steps executed during the test. This array will be continuously updated throughout the test as more steps are completed. Each element of the array corresponds to the `data` field of the step output, which can be viewed in the test editor UI.
  - For [Module](/steps/module) and [AI action](/steps/ai-action) steps, the result of the overall step will be equal to the result of the final sub-step.

### In a module

[Modules](/steps/module) have their own context that is independent from any tests that include them. They can also be passed data via parameters and inputs. This can be useful when you need to test similar scenarios with different inputs.

When editing a module, you can add parameters to the module definition and use them in the module steps using the `{{ }}` syntax. Reference module parameters using the following syntax `{{ inputs.PARAMETER_NAME }}`.

## Updating data

You can use the special `setVariable` function within [JavaScript](/steps/javascript) steps to modify the `env` global object. Non-serializable values such as functions and circular objects will be rejected.

The function signature of `setVariable` function is as follows:

```ts
function setVariable(name: string, value: unknown);
```

### In a module

[Modules](/steps/module) do automatically inherit all values on `env` from its parent test at the **time of execution**. This means that if you modify `env` inside a [Module](/steps/module), it will not affect the parent test context.
