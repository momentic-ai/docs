title: Generating fake data
description: Generating fake data in Momentic tests
---

Momentic tests preloads [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/). This library allows you to generate fake data for your tests. You can use it to generate random names, addresses, emails, and more.

## Usage

To use faker.js in your tests, you can call the `faker` function directly. Here's an example:

```
TYPE "{{ faker.internet.userName() }}" into "username input"
```

This step will generate a random username and type it into the username input field.

You can also use faker.js inside [JavaScript](/steps/javascript) steps to generate more complex data. Here's an example:

```js
const firstName = faker.name.firstName();
const lastName = faker.name.lastName();
const email = faker.internet.email(firstName, lastName);

const person = {
  firstName,
  lastName,
  email,
};

// makes the person object available to other steps as env.FAKE_PERSON
setVariable("FAKE_PERSON", person);
```
