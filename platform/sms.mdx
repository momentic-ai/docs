Momentic allows you to send and receive SMS messages in your tests. This feature is useful for testing SMS-based authentication, notifications, and other features that require sending and receiving SMS messages.

## Usage

SMS support is currently surfaced through the [JavaScript](/steps/javascript) step. There are two main functions you can use to interact with SMS messages:

- `sendSms`: Sends an SMS message to a phone number.
- `waitForLatestSms`: Retrieves the most recent SMS message sent to your dedicated phone number.

The function signature of these functions are as follows:

```ts
function sendSms(params: {
  body: string;
  to: string;
  from: string;
}): Promise<void>;

function waitForLatestSms(params: {
  to?: string;
  from?: string;
  timeout?: number;
}): Promise<{ body: string }>;
```

Here's an example of how you can use these functions in your tests:

```js
// substitute with your own phone numbers
const fromNumber = "+###########";
const toNumber = "+###########";

// send sms
await sendSms({
  body: "Refer",
  to: toNumber,
  from: fromNumber,
});

const firstMessage = await waitForLatestSms({
  to: fromNumber,
  timeout: 5_000,
});

// assert on content
assert(firstMessage && firstMessage.body.includes("Thanks for engaging"));

// send confirmation
await sendSms({
  body: "1",
  to: toNumber,
  from: fromNumber,
});

// get reply message
const secondMessage = await waitForLatestSms({
  to: fromNumber,
  timeout: 5_000,
});

assert(secondMessage);

// use regex to extract link from message body
const link = secondMessage.body.match(/https?:\/\/[^\s]+/)[0];

return link;
```
