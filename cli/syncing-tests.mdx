## Pushing tests

You can push tests by path or directory. A very common workflow is when you merge code to your main branch, you will run the push command in CI to sync tests to Momentic Cloud.

**Step 1**: Get an API key:

You will need an [API key](/essentials/getting-an-api-key) to authenticate against Momentic's servers.

**Step 2**: Push tests to Momentic Cloud:

Make sure this is in the same directory as your `./momentic` directory.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx momentic@latest push <paths...>
````

```bash yarn
yarn dlx momentic@latest push <paths...>
```

</CodeGroup>

## Pulling tests

Pulling tests will put them inside the ./momentic directory. You can freely group them with arbitrary folders and directories.

**Step 1**: Get an API key:

You will need an [API key](/essentials/getting-an-api-key) to authenticate against Momentic's servers.

**Step 2**: Pull tests from Momentic Cloud:

Make sure this is in the same directory as your `./momentic` directory.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx momentic@latest pull [options] [tests...]
````

```bash yarn
yarn dlx momentic@latest pull [options] [tests...]
```

</CodeGroup>

### Arguments

| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `tests`  | One or more test paths to pull from Momentic Cloud. |         |

A test path is a lowercased version of your test name where spaces are replaced with underscores: 'npx momentic pull hello-world'.

### Options

| Option      | Description                                                                                                  | Default |
