**Step 1**: Get an API key:

You will need an [API key](/get-started/getting-an-api-key) to authenticate against Momentic's servers.

**Step 2**: Install browsers:

This will download the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit browsers to your local machine.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx momentic@latest install-browsers
````

```bash yarn
yarn dlx momentic@latest install-browsers
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 3**: Run tests:

Make sure this is in the same directory as your `./momentic` directory.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx momentic@latest run [options] [tests...]
````

```bash yarn
yarn dlx momentic@latest run [options] [tests...]
```

</CodeGroup>
 
## Arguments

| Argument | Description                   | Default |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `tests`  | One or more test identifiers. |         |

To use tests stored on your local file system, pass '--local' and specify file paths to Momentic YAML files or folders that exist locally: 'npx momentic run --local momentic/hello-world.yaml'.

To use tests stored remotely on Momentic Cloud, pass '--remote' and specify one or more test paths. A test path is a lowercased version of your test name where spaces are replaced with dashes: 'npx momentic run --remote hello-world'.
