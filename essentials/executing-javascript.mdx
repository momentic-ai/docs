title: Executing JavaScript
description: Executing arbitrary JavaScript as part of Momentic tests
---

You can execute JavaScript in two ways on the Momentic platform:

1. **[JavaScript](/steps/javascript) step**: this is a special step that allows you execute a block of JavaScript code.
   - The returned value is the result of the JavaScript step.
2. **`{{}}` expressions**: String fields in all steps can contain JavaScript expressions inside curly brackets. For example, the value of a `Type` step can be `{{ env.USERNAME }}@gmail.com` .
   - You do not need to include a `return` statement.
   - The expression inside the curly braces must be a single line. If you need multiple lines, use the JavaScript step.

## Global Libraries

In addition to the built-in libraries provided by NodeJS, the following external libraries are available to you in JavaScript steps and `{{}}` expressions:

- `axios`: Send HTTP/HTTPS requests to other servers
- `assert`: Execute assertions based on other variables and constants
- `faker`: Generate mock data easily
- `moment`: Create and manipulate `Date` objects
