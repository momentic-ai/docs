## Content-based assertions

By default, Momenticâ€™s AI uses a processed accessibility tree representation of your application to make decisions.

<Info>
  When using content-based assertions, our AI has access to the **whole page**,
  not just the portion visible in the viewport. This is also significantly
  faster.
</Info>

## Data tables

- Content-based assertions are great for analyzing and asserting on tabular data. Our AI can accurately understand data present in a HTML table.
- If you are using techniques such as list virtualization where only visible rows are rendered, you will have to use the `Scroll` step to make sure other rows are shown.

## Vision-based assertions

To enable vision, turn on `Use vision` in the step configuration. This mode is effective for assertions that include color, position on the page, or visual information like layout.

<Info>
  Turning on vision would limit our AI to the **current visible viewport** as it
  relies on a screenshot of the page.
</Info>

### Data visualizations

- We support SVG or canvas based data visualizations rendered by libraries such as D3, Hicharts, Recharts, and more.
- Accuracy improves when there are clear labels and axes within the viewport.
- For interactive visualizations, use [Click](/steps/click) or [Hover](/steps/hover) steps to show tooltips and interact with data visualizations.
