description: How does Momentic's auto waiting work?
---

Momentic tests automatically detect when the page has finished loading and when the page is ready for interaction after executing each step.

Momentic uses a combination of the following strategies to determine when the page is ready for the next step:

1. **Network idle**: Momentic waits for the network to be idle for a certain amount of time.
2. **DOM ready**: Momentic waits for the DOM to be ready. Specifically the `load` and `DOMContentLoaded` events.

You can turn this behavior off in test settings if you want to manually control waiting via [AI wait](/steps/ai-wait) or [Wait](/steps/wait) steps.
