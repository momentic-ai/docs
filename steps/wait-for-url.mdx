</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="timeout" type="number">

  If no timeout is provided, the timeout will be set to the default page load timeout, which is configurable in the test options dialog.

## Glob pitfalls
Be aware of the common pitfalls surrounding glob patterns. We recommend testing your pattern with an [online tool](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob) to ensure the results match your expectations.

1. `**/*` does not match empty strings. For example, if the current URL is `https://google.com/`:
   <CardGroup cols={2}>
     <Card icon="xmark" color="#D32F2F">
      `https://google.com/**/*` does not match.
     </Card>
     <Card icon="check" color="#43A047">
     `https://**/*` does match.
     </Card>
   </CardGroup>
  
2. `*` does not match `/` characters. For example, if the current URL is `https://docs.momentic.ai/steps/wait-for-url`:
   <CardGroup cols={2}>
     <Card icon="xmark" color="#D32F2F">
      `https://docs.momentic.ai/steps*` does not match.
     </Card>
     <Card icon="check" color="#43A047">
     `https://docs.momentic.ai/steps/*` does match.
     </Card>
   </CardGroup>

3. When placed within a single path segment, `**` does not match recursive paths. For example, if the current URL is `https://momentic.ai/schedule-demo/book`:
   <CardGroup cols={2}>
     <Card icon="xmark" color="#D32F2F">
      `https://momentic.ai/schedule-demo**` does not match.
     </Card>
     <Card icon="check" color="#43A047">
     `https://momentic.ai/schedule-demo/*` does match.
     </Card>
   </CardGroup>
