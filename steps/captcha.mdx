Momentic can solve CAPTCHAs for you. This step is useful when you need to automate a process that requires human intervention to solve a CAPTCHA.

We use [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/) to solve CAPTCHAs.

This is a no-op when running tests with Momentic Cloud or with the CLI as it can cause test flakiness and delays.
