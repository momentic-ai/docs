Modules are a way to group steps together so that they can be reused across multiple tests.

A module can have any number of parameters. These parameters can have input values assigned to them when the module is used in a test. The parameters can then be accessed in the steps that are part of the module.

The following is an example of a module that takes two parameters, `name` and `age`, and how a step in the module can access these parameters:

```
{{ inputs.name }} is {{ inputs.age }} years old
```

For more information on how variables can be accessed in a step that is part of a module, see [Test context](/essentials/test-context).

## Caching

Cached modules are a way to store the results of a module so that they can be reused across multiple tests without re-executing. A common use case is to cache the results of a module that performs a login action, so that the login action does not need to be repeated in every test.

Create a cached module by turning on the `Cache result` toggle in the module settings.

You must specify a unique cache key. This key is used to identify the cached result and retrieve it. Module inputs are automatically appended to the key to ensure that the cached result is unique for each set of inputs.
