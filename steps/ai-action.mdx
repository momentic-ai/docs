AI actions are special steps that expand into a series of sub-steps based on a goal you provide. The sub-steps are automatically generated by our AI agent.

AI actions are useful for the following use cases:

- Completing forms, including login pages and submissions
- Measuring the accessibility and ease-of-use of your site

AI actions should **not** be used to execute single interactions on your page - please use our other steps like [Click](/steps/click) or [Type](/steps/type) instead, which are far simpler and execute more deterministically.

Our AI will continue generating steps until it believes your goal has been accomplished, at which point it will output a special `Done` step that is only allowed at the end of AI actions and cannot be moved.

## Inputs

<ResponseField name="goal" type="string" required>
  High-level goal that you want the AI to achieve. The prompt should include any
  variables required to complete the task, such as credentials ("login
  usingÂ mypassword"), descriptors ("add a 128GB iPad to my cart"), and option
  choices ("decline all add-ons and checkout").
</ResponseField>
