## Configs

<ResponseField name="hover duration" type="number">
  Number of seconds to wait before dropping the element. This can be useful for
  ensuring that mouse and hover events are triggered before the drop completes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="disable stability checks" type="boolean" default={false}>
  Do not wait for the element to be visible, stable and actionable before
  interacting. Useful for elements that are constantly animating or partially
  obscured.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="use css selector" type="boolean" default={false}>
  Treat the element description as a CSS selector. This is not recommended for
  maintainability reasons but can be useful for dynamic pages.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="visible area only" type="boolean" default={false}>
  Search for the element in the current visible area only. Improves performance
  and accuracy for long pages. Does not affect vision descriptions, which always
  use the visible area only.
</ResponseField>
